# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [PasteSheets](https://github.com/newfull5/PasteSheets)! Your contributions help move the project forward.

## 📋 Issue Reporting Guidelines

When proposing new features or reporting bugs, please follow these rules:

1.  **Check for Duplicates**: Before opening a new issue, please search to see if a similar issue already exists.
2.  **Use Templates**: If bug report or feature proposal templates are available, please fill them out in as much detail as possible.
3.  **Clear Titles**: Use clear and concise titles so the content of the issue can be understood at a glance.
4.  **Reproduction Steps**: For bug reports, please include specific steps to reproduce the issue.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

We follow this branching strategy for efficient collaboration:

-   **Main Branch (`main` or `master`)**: Maintains a stable, deployable state.
-   **Work Branches**: Branch off from `main` to work, and merge back via PR when work is complete.

### Branch Naming Conventions
-   Feature: `feature/feature-name` (e.g., `feature/search-bar`)
-   Bug Fix: `fix/bug-description` (e.g., `fix/crash-on-save`)
-   Documentation: `docs/description` (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
-   Refactoring: `refactor/description`

## 💬 Commit Message Conventions

We recommend following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for readable history management.

-   `feat`: A new feature
-   `fix`: A bug fix
-   `docs`: Documentation only changes
-   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
-   `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

**Example**:
```
feat: add clipboard search functionality
fix: fix crash when saving settings
```

## 🚀 Pull Request Process

1.  **Create PR**: Push your working branch to the remote repository and create a Pull Request.
2.  **Description**: Please provide a clear description of the changes and link related issue numbers.
3.  **Code Review**: Receive reviews from maintainers or other contributors. Please actively incorporate feedback.
4.  **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass.
5.  **Merge**: Once the review is approved and tests pass, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
